  Unleash Your Creativity with AI-Powered Adventures
  Welcome to the D&D Campaign Generator! This Next.js application empowers Dungeon Masters to craft unique and engaging campaigns with the help of Google's Gemini AI. Simply     fill out a few details about your desired adventure, and let the AI do the heavy lifting, generating a tailored campaign outline complete with intriguing storylines,         
  challenging encounters, and memorable locations.

  AI-Powered Generation: Leverages Google's Gemini to generate a detailed campaign outline based on your input.
  Customization: You'll have the option to fine-tune the generated prompt or even start from scratch.
  Seamless Integration: Built with Next.js for a smooth user experience and easy deployment.
